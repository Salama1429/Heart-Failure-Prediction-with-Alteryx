# Heart-Failure-Prediction-with-Alteryx
## Heart Failure Prediction with Alteryx tool

### Steps:
  ##### 1-Importing the Data.
  ##### 2-Exploratory Data Analysis (format columns data types, data wrangling, and Visualization).
  ##### 3-Feature Engineering and Sampling (filtering data and sampling, and join the data).
  ##### 4-Machine Learning (base line model and select the best model).
  ##### 5-Prediction.
